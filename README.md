# Chinook Dashboard â€” SQL-Driven Business Intelligence in Shiny

This interactive dashboard analyzes the [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) music store dataset using SQL, R, and Shiny to surface business insights on revenue performance, customer retention, and purchase behavior.

**Why This Project?**  
Designed as a compact but scalable demonstration of real-world business analytics workflows. While the dataset is small, the app simulates BI tooling for datasets in the hundreds of millions.
