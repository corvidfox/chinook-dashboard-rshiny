The Chinook dataset reveals that revenue is predominantly concentrated in North America and Central Europe, with stable year-over-year trends. However, notable anomalies—such as Australia’s post-2013 revenue drop and a Europe-wide spike in 2011—suggest operational or market influences worth deeper exploration.

Genre performance remains consistent overall, but monetization efficiency varies significantly. Top genres by revenue-per-track tend to be niche with high engagement, while top artists by total revenue rely on volume across many tracks rather than high per-track returns.

Customer retention drops sharply within the first six months but shows unexpected spikes around months 28–33, suggesting irregular purchase behavior or promotional effects.

Strategic opportunities include expanding in underpenetrated yet high-value markets, tailoring content and marketing by region and genre, optimizing large but underperforming catalogs, and implementing targeted retention and re-engagement campaigns.
